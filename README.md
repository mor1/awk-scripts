IETF BibTeX Creation
====================

This project is licensed under the MIT license.

These are some [gawk](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/) scripts for processing
various IETF index files to produce BibTeX. As regex based parsers they're quite
brittle and rely on consistent formatting of the input. Also included are some
shell scripts to drive them.
